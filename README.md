# Important!
When you get the link to sync with your favorite idle, which I hope is CLion, use the project address instead of the directory. Example:

**Test** project.

https://github.com/viniciosbarretos/data-structure/test => Good - "You are so cute and clever, here take 100,000 US dollars." 
https://github.com/viniciosbarretos/data-structure => Bad - "You're a monster, what horror, nobody likes you."

Great for your attention
